Code used to generate plots used in https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00094 .

The most important part is main.cpp; other than that, there are many shell scripts for running the simulation or plotting the results. 
This code was meant to be used once for a specific purpose, hence it is missing a lot of otherwise useful accessories, such as a Makefile.
